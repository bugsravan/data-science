# Data Science
All the data science stuff goes here.

- [Energy forecasting step-by-step](https://github.com/bugsravan/data-science/blob/master/EnergyForecasting.pdf): This notebook takes a step-by-step approach through all the analysis  with detailed explanation for performing daily forecasting. My observations are listed at the end of the file. 
- [Energy forecasting api](https://github.com/bugsravan/data-science/blob/master/api-meter-hourly-tsAnalysis.ipynb): This notebook takes an API style approach. Here all the steps are wrapped into modules to make it easy to expose as APIs. Here I am performing hourly forecasting.
- [Cluster electric meters](https://github.com/bugsravan/data-science/blob/master/Clustering_electric_meters.pdf): This is a prototype of electric meters clustering using their voltage data.
